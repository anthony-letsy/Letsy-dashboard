# API Key Hashing Implementation Summary

## What Was Changed

### 1. Dependencies Added
- `bcryptjs` - For secure password hashing
- `@types/bcryptjs` - TypeScript types

### 2. Database Schema Updated
**New SQL Migration**: `add-api-key-hash.sql`
- Added `key_hash` column to `api_keys` table
- Created index on `key_hash` for faster lookups
- Added RLS policy for service role access

### 3. Dashboard Updated
**File**: `src/app/dashboard/api-keys/page.tsx`
- Imports bcrypt library
- Generates longer, more secure keys (45+ characters)
- Hashes keys using bcrypt with 10 rounds
- Stores both plain text and hash in database
- Plain text shown to user only once during generation

### 4. Documentation Created

**API-AUTHENTICATION.md**
- Complete authentication implementation guide
- Step-by-step instructions for API developers
- Code examples for Node.js/Express and Next.js
- Security best practices
- Performance optimization tips
- Troubleshooting guide

**README.md Updated**
- Added API Authentication section
- Updated database schema documentation
- Added migration instructions
- Updated feature list

## How It Works

### Dashboard Side (Generation)
1. User clicks "Generate new key"
2. Dashboard creates random key: `letsy_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
3. Dashboard hashes key with bcrypt (10 rounds)
4. Dashboard stores both plain and hash in database
5. User sees plain text key once and copies it

### API Side (Authentication)
1. Client sends API request with key in header
2. API extracts key from `Authorization: Bearer` header
3. API queries database for all active (non-revoked) key hashes
4. API compares provided key against each hash using `bcrypt.compare()`
5. If match found, request is authenticated with partner_id
6. If no match, request is rejected with 401

## Why This Approach?

### Shared Database Architecture
- **Single source of truth**: Dashboard and API use same Supabase database
- **No manual copying**: Keys automatically available to API
- **Real-time updates**: Revocations take effect immediately
- **Partner identification**: API can identify which partner made each request

### Security Benefits
- **One-way hashing**: Plain text keys cannot be retrieved from database
- **Bcrypt strength**: Industry-standard hashing with configurable rounds
- **Revocation support**: Keys can be instantly disabled
- **Service role access**: API uses privileged connection to bypass RLS

## Next Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor
-- Run the contents of: add-api-key-hash.sql
```

### 2. Test Key Generation
- Navigate to API Keys page in dashboard
- Generate a new test key
- Copy the key
- Verify it's stored in database with hash

### 3. Implement in Your API
- Follow the guide in API-AUTHENTICATION.md
- Use the provided code examples
- Test with the generated key
- Monitor authentication logs

### 4. Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Run migration in production database
- [ ] Update API with authentication middleware
- [ ] Set `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in API environment
- [ ] Test authentication with real keys
- [ ] Monitor for authentication errors
- [ ] Document API usage for partners

## Files Modified/Created

### Created
- `add-api-key-hash.sql` - Database migration for API key hashing
- `add-partner-to-formations.sql` - Database migration to link formations to partners
- `API-AUTHENTICATION.md` - API implementation guide
- `IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Modified
- `package.json` - Added bcryptjs dependencies
- `src/app/dashboard/api-keys/page.tsx` - Added key hashing
- `src/app/dashboard/formations/page.tsx` - Filter formations by partner_id
- `README.md` - Updated documentation

## Testing Checklist

### API Key Hashing
- [ ] Run `add-api-key-hash.sql` migration
- [ ] New keys are generated with hashes
- [ ] Keys are longer and more secure
- [ ] Plain text shown only once to user
- [ ] Hashes are stored in database
- [ ] API can authenticate with generated keys
- [ ] Revoked keys are rejected
- [ ] Invalid keys are rejected

### Formations Filtering
- [ ] Run `add-partner-to-formations.sql` migration
- [ ] Partners only see their own formations
- [ ] Creating new formations automatically assigns partner_id
- [ ] RLS policies prevent cross-partner data access

## Performance Considerations

Bcrypt comparison is CPU-intensive. For production:

1. **Implement caching** (5-minute TTL recommended)
2. **Use database indexes** (already created by migration)
3. **Consider key prefix validation** (reject non-`letsy_` keys early)
4. **Monitor CPU usage** during authentication
5. **Scale horizontally** if needed

## Security Notes

1. ✅ Keys are hashed with bcrypt (10 rounds)
2. ✅ Plain text keys shown only once
3. ✅ Service role key required for API authentication
4. ✅ RLS policies protect partner data
5. ✅ Index on key_hash for performance
6. ⚠️ Keep service role key secure
7. ⚠️ Always use HTTPS for API requests
8. ⚠️ Implement rate limiting per key

## Troubleshooting

### Key generation fails
- Check bcrypt is installed: `npm list bcryptjs`
- Verify database connection
- Check for RLS policy issues

### API authentication fails
- Verify service role key is set
- Check bcrypt.compare() is awaited
- Ensure key_hash column exists
- Confirm key is not revoked

### Slow authentication
- Implement caching
- Verify database index exists
- Consider fewer bcrypt rounds (not recommended)
